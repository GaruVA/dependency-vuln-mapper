[![Status: Research Phase](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-research-yellow)](https://github.com/GaruVA/dependency-chain-vulnerability-mapper)

A tool for visualizing and analyzing how vulnerabilities propagate through software dependency chains — helping developers prioritize security fixes based on **actual exploitability paths**, not just flat CVE lists.


## 🔍 Overview

Modern software projects depend on complex webs of direct and transitive dependencies. When a vulnerability is reported deep in the tree, developers often face questions like:

* Which of my dependencies are actually affected?
* How does the vulnerability propagate to my application?
* Are there exploitable paths from my app to the vulnerable code?
* What’s the most efficient remediation strategy with minimal breakage?

This tool tackles these questions by providing **interactive, actionable, and visual insights** into your project’s dependency network and vulnerabilities.


## 🌟 Key Features (Planned)

* 📈 **Interactive Dependency Tree** — Visual graph of direct & transitive dependencies, with severity heatmaps.
* 🛡️ **Vulnerability Path Tracing** — Highlight actual paths from your application to the vulnerable package.
* 🚦 **Risk Prioritization** — Focus on reachable, runtime, high-impact vulnerabilities — not noise.
* 🔄 **Smart Remediation Suggestions** — Minimal, non-breaking upgrade paths to fix vulnerabilities.
* 🌐 **Multi-Ecosystem Support** — npm, pip, Maven, etc.
* ⚙️ **CI/CD Integration** — Automated scanning and actionable reports during builds.


## 🚧 Current Status

We are in the **research & planning phase**, actively exploring:

* Approaches to vulnerability mapping & exploitability analysis.
* Visualization techniques that scale to large graphs.
* Integration with vulnerability databases (NVD, OSV, GitHub Advisories).
* Tech stacks and graph libraries.

We welcome your **ideas, research, and contributions**!


## 🛠️ Getting Started

At this stage, there is **no working implementation yet**.
Check back soon for:

* Installation instructions
* Configuration options
* Usage examples


## 🔮 Vision

We aim to build a tool that:<br>
✅ Provides deeper insight than static vulnerability lists.<br>
✅ Highlights real, exploitable paths based on actual code usage.<br>
✅ Suggests actionable, minimal-change fixes.<br>
✅ Fits naturally into existing developer workflows.<br>
✅ Supports multiple ecosystems and CI/CD pipelines.
