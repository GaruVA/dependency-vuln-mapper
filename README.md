A tool for visualizing and analyzing how vulnerabilities propagate through complex software dependency chains, enabling developers to make informed decisions about security risks in their codebase.

## 🔍 Overview

Modern software relies on extensive dependency trees, often containing hundreds or thousands of packages. When vulnerabilities occur deep in these trees, understanding their impact becomes challenging:

- Which of your dependencies are actually affected?
- How does the vulnerability propagate to your application?
- Which paths represent exploitable attack vectors?
- What's the most efficient remediation strategy?

The Dependency Chain Vulnerability Mapper addresses these challenges by creating interactive visualizations of dependency networks with vulnerability overlays, providing context-aware risk assessment beyond what traditional vulnerability scanners offer.

## 🌟 Key Features (Planned)

- **Dependency Tree Visualization**: Interactive graph representation of your project's direct and transitive dependencies
- **Vulnerability Path Tracing**: Highlight paths from vulnerable components to your application
- **Risk Prioritization**: Assess real-world impact based on exploitability and dependency usage
- **Smart Remediation Suggestions**: Recommendations for the most efficient upgrade paths with minimal breaking changes
- **Multi-Ecosystem Support**: Analysis for multiple package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated scanning during your build process

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in the **early research and planning phase**. We are:

- Investigating vulnerability mapping approaches
- Researching visualization techniques
- Exploring integration with vulnerability databases
- Evaluating potential tech stacks

We welcome ideas, suggestions, and contributions from security researchers, developers, and the open-source community.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

As this project is in its initial phase, there's no implementation yet. Check back soon for:

- Installation instructions

## 🔮 Vision

Our long-term vision is to create a comprehensive tool that:

1. Provides deeper insight than flat vulnerability lists
2. Considers actual code paths and usage patterns
3. Offers actionable remediation strategies
4. Integrates with existing security workflows
5. Supports multiple ecosystems and package managers

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds, especially during this early phase:

- **Ideas and Research**: Share papers, techniques, or existing approaches
- **Design Input**: Suggestions on UI/UX for vulnerability visualization
- **Technical Expertise**: Insights on specific package ecosystems or vulnerability analysis
- **Use Cases**: Share your organization's challenges with dependency vulnerabilities
